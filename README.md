# TimeFlow Scheduler

TimeFlow Scheduler is an open-source meeting scheduling tool that replaces the conventional interval-selection interface with an intuitive timeline. Users can drag along a 24‑hour timeline to set their preferred availability using color-coded statuses:
- **Green:** Available  
- **Yellow:** Tentative  
- **Red:** Unavailable

Once all participants submit their availabilities, the tool aggregates the selections to suggest meeting slots.

## Features
- **Visual Timeline Interface:** Select time ranges via drag-and-drop.
- **Color-Coded Availability:** Easily indicate available, tentative, or unavailable time slots.
- **Aggregated Scheduling:** View combined availabilities for quick meeting slot selection.
- **Modern Stack:** Built with React, Python Flask, and PostgreSQL.
- **Dockerized:** Simple deployment using Docker Compose.
- **Open Source:** Community driven – contributions are welcome!
